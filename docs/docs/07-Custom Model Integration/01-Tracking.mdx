As a versatile platform, nutsh defines an interface that enables the integration of any tracking model to aid your work, which enables features like [audo-tracking in videos](/Usage/Video/Auto%20Tracking).
Additionally, nutsh offers an [officially maintained tracking implementation](https://github.com/SysCV/nutsh/tree/main/example/track-aot) for out-of-the-box use.

The interface for tracking is defined using gRPC and can be found at [proto/definition/service/v1/track.proto](https://github.com/SysCV/nutsh/blob/main/proto/definition/service/v1/segmentation.proto).
This documentation will not delve into this definition, as it is intended for advanced usage when our Python SDK can not meet your needs, in which case you may need to implement a gRPC tracking service on your own.

## Python Integration

Nutsh provides a [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/nutsh/) to assist in integrating your tracking model into the platform more quickly and user-friendly.
You can take the example implementation at [example/track-aot](https://github.com/SysCV/nutsh/tree/main/example/track-aot) utilizing [Segment-and-Track-Anything](https://github.com/z-x-yang/Segment-and-Track-Anything) as a reference.
Besides, there is also a minimal mocking implementation in [example/track-mock](https://github.com/SysCV/nutsh/tree/main/example/track-mock) which does nothing but to demonstrate how to use the SDK.

Take the following steps to start a new implementation from scratch. 


0. Install our Python SDK.
    ```
    pip install nutsh
    ```

1. Implement a `nutsh.track.Tracker` which is an abstract class requires only one method:
    ```python
    from nutsh.track import Tracker

    class TrackerImpl(Tracker):
        def predict(self, im_path: str) -> Mask:
            # to be implemented
    ```
    This method will be called sequentially on each subsequent images to be predicted.

2. Implement an initialization function:
    ```python
    def new_tracker(first_image_path: str, first_image_mask: Mask) -> Tracker:
        # to be implemented
    ```
    This function will be called upon an new incoming request with the local path and segmentation mask of the first image.

3. Finally, create a tracking service and start it:
    ```python
    from nutsh.track import Service

    ser = Service(workspace="/path/to/some/folder", on_reqeust=new_tracker)
    ser.start(port=12348)
    ```
    It will start the server which listens on port `12348`.

To put everything together the scaffold looks like:
```python
from nutsh.track import Service, Tracker
from nutsh.proto.schema.v1.train_pb2 import Mask

class TrackerImpl(Tracker):
    def predict(self, im_path: str) -> Mask:
        # to be implemented
        raise Exception("not implemented")

def new_tracker(first_image_path: str, first_image_mask: Mask) -> Tracker:
    # to be implemented
    raise Exception("not implemented")

ser = Service(workspace="/path/to/some/folder", on_reqeust=new_tracker)
ser.start(port=12348)
```

Check [example/track-aot](https://github.com/SysCV/nutsh/tree/main/example/track-aot) for a real-world ready-to-use example, or [example/track-mock](https://github.com/SysCV/nutsh/tree/main/example/track-mock) for a minimal starting point.
