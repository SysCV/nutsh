Given that an annotation comprises several [entities](/Concept#video),
each containing one or more [components](/Concept#component),
it's crucial to allow manipulation among them.
Below are all the possible manipulations.

## Shifting Components and Entities

There may be times when slight adjustments to the positions of components are necessary,
such as following interpolation or after copy-pasting.

To move a single component, follow these steps:

- Hover your mouse over the component you wish to move.
- Click and hold the left mouse button.
- Drag the component to its desired position.

Occasionally, an entity might consist of multiple components,
or you may need to shift multiple entities at the same time.
Instead of moving each component one by one, you can shift them all at once:

- Select all the entities you wish to move.
- Press and hold <kbd>Shift</kbd>.
- Click and drag in any blank area on the canvas.

## Transferring a Component

There may be instances where you need to move a component from its current entity to another.
This can occur if, for example, you accidentally draw a component to the wrong entity.
To transfer a component, follow these steps

- Right-click on the component you wish to transfer.
- Select "_Transfer_" from the context menu that appears.
- Click on the destination entity.

## Detaching a Component

There may be situations where,
rather than reassigning a component to an existing entity,
it would be necessary to create a new entity from that specific component.
Here's how you can achieve this:

- Right-click on the component in question.
- Select "_Detach_" from the contextual menu.

## Deleting a Component

If you wish to remove a single component from an entity, follow the steps below:

- Right-click on the component you want to remove.
- From the context menu, select 'Delete'.

## Copying Entities

This feature allows for copying entities from one frame and pasting them onto another.
This can prove helpful, especially when one needs to replicate drawn entities across multiple frames with minor variations.
To copy one or more entities, follow these steps:

- Select the desired entities.
- Press <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd> or right-click anywhere on the canvas and select "_Copy_".
- Navigate to the destination frame.
- Press <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>V</kbd> or right-click anywhere on the canvas and select "_Paste_".

All components of the copied entities will be replicated onto the target frame.

## Clearing Entities in a Frame

If you wish to remove all components of some entities in a particular frame, follow these steps:

- Select the desired entities.
- Right-click on a blank area of the canvas.
- Click "_Clear_".

This action does not affect their components in other frames.

## Truncating Entities

Occasionally you might want to delete all components of some entities from a certain frame forward,
for example when adjusting segmentation outcomes from [auto-tracking](/Usage/Video/Auto%20Tracking).
This can be efficiently achieved by truncating the selected entities. Here's how to do it:

- Select the desired entities.
- Right-click on a blank area of the canvas.
- Click "_Truncate_".

## Purging Entities

If you need to remove some entities entirely, not just from a single frame, follow these steps:

- Select the desired entities.
- Right-click on a blank area of the canvas.
- Click "_Purge_".

This will completely remove the selected entities from the annotation.
