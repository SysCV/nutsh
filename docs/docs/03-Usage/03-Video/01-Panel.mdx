## Viewport

You can readily zoom or pan the canvas either through the user interface or by using keyboard shortcuts.
The latter is especially useful when you're in the midst of drawing.
Essentially, the moment you press and hold the <kbd>Option/Alt</kbd>, you activate the transformation mode.
In this mode, all your mouse movements directly facilitate canvas transformations.
Simply drag to pan and scroll the wheel to zoom.

## Undo and Redo

The entire annotation history is tracked.
At any time, you can navigate through it using undo or redo.
The keyboard shortcut is <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Z</kbd> and <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>Z</kbd> respectively.

## Entity Selection

Some actions require you to select one or more entities first. This can be easily accomplished directly on the canvas.

- To select a single entity, simply click on one of its components.
- To select multiple entities, there are two methods:
  - hold the <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> and click on components of the desired entities;
  - hold the <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> and drag a box to encompass for each desired entity at least one of its component.

Remember, batch selecting by dragging will always reset the current selection to the ones currently enclosed.
To add to the existing selection rather than resetting it, hold <kbd>Shift</kbd>.

:::note
Selecting a mask component can be a bit tricky, because unlike polygons or rectangles,
directly clicking on a mask will initiate the editing process. To simply select it without editing, use the multiple selection method:
hold down the <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> and click, or drag a box to enclose it.
:::

:::note

When batch selecting by dragging, a component is only considered enclosed when it's entirely within the selection box.

:::

You can always press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to clear the selection.

## Operations with Entity Selection

After selecting one or more entities, the following operations can be performed:

- Invert Selection <kbd>I</kbd> : This operation allows you to select all entities that are not currently selected within the frame.
- Hide Others <kbd>H</kbd> : Using this operation will make all entities, except for your current selection, invisible.
- Focus <kbd>F</kbd> : This operation adjusts the viewport of the canvas to center on the selected entities.
