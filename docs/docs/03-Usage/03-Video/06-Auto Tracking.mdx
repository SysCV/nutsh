[Smart Segmentation](/Usage/Video/Smart%20Segmentation) is an excellent feature for automatically segmenting objects within a single frame.
However, in video annotation, it's often necessary to track an object across multiple frames.
Rather than laboriously annotating each frame manually, nutsh's auto-tracking feature can streamline this task, offering a more efficient and precise approach.

Before using auto tracking, first make sure the nutsh core is connected to a [track module](/Quick%20Start#track-module). Once ready, take the following steps to initiate an auto tracking:

- Draw the mask on the starting frame for the object you want to track.
- Once you have the initial mask in hand, right-click on it.
- Select the "*Auto Track*" option to start auto tracking.
- Once started, a loading indicator will appear in the entity card, which will later become a progress bar.
- The process is finished when the progress bar reaches its end.

:::tip

Nothing is blocked when auto trackings are underway. You can continue working on the canvas, e.g. draw other annotations or start examine the tracking results in real-time.

:::tip

You can initiate as many auto trackings as you want, as long as your GPU memory allows.

:::caution

The platform is agnostic to the tracking model and the tracking results may be good or bad depending on the actual model used.
In case of our officially maintained demonstrative [AOT Tracker](https://github.com/SysCV/nutsh/tree/main/example/track-aot) utilizing [Segment-and-Track-Anything](https://github.com/z-x-yang/Segment-and-Track-Anything), there can be false positives on unexpected frames.
As a result, further manual examinations and corrections might be necessary. Check other features nutsh offers, e.g. [truncating entities](/Usage/Video/Entity#truncating-entities), to see how such work can be facilitated.
