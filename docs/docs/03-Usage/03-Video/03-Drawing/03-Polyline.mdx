Polygons and polylines are collectively referred to as [polygonal chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonal_chain).
Polygons are closed shapes, while polylines are not. As a result, they share a common set of manipulations.
You may refer to the documentation for polygons for the following operations on polylines:

- [Undo and Redo](Polygon#undo-and-redo)
- [Bézier Curve](Polygon#bézier-curve)
- [Slice Clone](Polygon#slice-clone)
