Resources refer to objects that are to be annotated, such as images, videos, point clouds, and so on. Currently, only videos are supported, but we certainly anticipate the inclusion of more resource types in the future.

## Video Management

Through the user interface, you can effortlessly create, search for, update, and delete videos.

## Loading Local Files

Resource assets are specified by their URLs. For example, a video is represented by a list of URLs for its frames.
Usually these URLs use the HTTP protocol, which is not convenient for directly loading local files.
To work with local files, follow the steps below:

1. Start nutsh with an additional flag `--data-dir <data_dir>` pointing to some directory where your data is located.
2. Identify the [origin](https://web.dev/same-site-same-origin/#origin) of the nutsh website you are visiting, which typically shoud be of the format `http(s)://<host>(:port)`.
3. Use `<nutsh_origin>/data/<rel_path>` for the file located at `<data_dir>/<rel_path>` on your local machine.
   - Pay attention to the `data` prefix in the URL before the relative path to your file.

For instance, if you have videos stored in:

```
/var/data/abc
    - video0001
        - frame0001.jpg
        - frame0002.jpg
        - ...
    - video0002
        - frame0001.jpg
        - frame0002.jpg
        - ...
    - ...
```

Start nutsh with the flag `--data-dir /var/data/abc`.

Then, if somehow you visit your deployed nutsh at `https://nutsh.my-instutite.com`, use the following URLs for your data:

```
https://nutsh.my-instutite.com/data/video0001/frame0001.jpg
https://nutsh.my-instutite.com/data/video0001/frame0002.jpg
...
```

:::tip

You can always enter the URL into the browser's address bar to check if it works.

While you can use `--data-dir /` to serve essentially any file, be aware that this exposes significant security risks for your host machine.
