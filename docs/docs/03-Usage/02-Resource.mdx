Resources refer to objects that are to be annotated, such as images, videos, point clouds, and so on. Currently, only videos are supported, but we certainly anticipate the inclusion of more resource types in the future.

## Video Management

Through the user interface, you can effortlessly create, search for, update, and delete videos.

## Loading Local Files

Resource assets are specified by their URLs, e.g. a video is represented by a list of urls of its frames.
By default, the URL should use the HTTP protocol, which isn't convenient for directly loading local files.
You can take the following steps to work with local files.

1. Start nutsh with an additional flag `--data-dir [data_dir]` pointing to some directory where your data is located.
2. Use `file://[rel_path]` as the URL for your resources, which will point to the file at `[data_dir]/[rel_path]` on your local machine.

For instance, if you're working with videos stored in

```
/var/data/abc
    - video0001
        - frame0001.jpg
        - frame0002.jpg
        - ...
    - video0002
        - frame0001.jpg
        - frame0002.jpg
        - ...
    - ...
```

Start nutsh with the flag `--data-dir /var/data/abc`, and create your videos with urls like

```
file://video0001/frame0001.jpg
file://video0001/frame0002.jpg
...
```

You may use `--data-dir /` to serve files with absolute paths, like `file:///var/data/abc/video0001/frame0001.jpg`, but do note that it exposes security risks for your host machine.
